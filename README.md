This is an implementation of "Wave Function Collapse" that I wrote in my final semester of school.
Wave Function Collapse, at least as far as this program is concerned, is tileset based system where every tile is indeterminate and can intelligently determined all possible tiles that it could be based on adjacency rules.


I went to architecture school, not programming school, so I make no claims about the quality of this code.
I don't really remember how it all works and I never intended to publish this, but here it is!
